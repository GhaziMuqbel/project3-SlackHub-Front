### **_About the project_**

#### Our Journey

After a busy journey in creating our first application, here we are, building something bigger and more complex. The world of technology is endless, and every day we learn something new.

#### Our App

The first thing we learned when we entered the GA Institute was the github website and the Slack application 
Github is my programming library that will accompany me throughout my endless journey in the world of programming 
As for Slack, it is a communication application between the student and the teacher 
My idea is to combine these two tools together to create an easy and simple means of communication between the student and the teacher. Of course, we will not be able to keep up with the features of the github site, but we will make communication between students and the teacher and solving and submitting assignments easier.
